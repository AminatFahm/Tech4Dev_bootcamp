        <h1><u><center>ABOUT MYSELF</center></u></h1>
        <p>My name is <b>Aminat Olajumoke Fahm-Yesufa</b>, I was born
            in Lagos, Nigeria. My Primary education was at Command
            Children School, Sabo, Yaba, Lagos, while my Secondary school education was at 
            Methodist Girl's High School, Sabo, Yaba, Lagos. 
            I had my first degree at the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.

            I'm married with two kids, my hobbies are reading and crafts making.
            I'll like to further my education in IT, that's one of the reasons this program
            is so important to me as I know it will give me a good headstart in IT.
